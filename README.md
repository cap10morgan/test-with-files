# test-with-files

A Clojure library to easily write tests with files.

## Install

Clojure CLI/deps.edn:

```clj
io.github.cap10morgan/test-with-files {:git/tag "v1.0.0" :git/sha ""}
```

## Usage

#### with-tmp-dir

You can request a temporary directory to use with your tests, which is
cleaned up afterwards.

```clj
(ns my-test
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]
            [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]
            [test-with-files.tools :refer [with-tmp-dir]]))

(deftest with-tmp-dir-test
  (is (= (with-tmp-dir tmp-dir
           (spit (io/file tmp-dir "foo.txt") "I'm here")
           (slurp (io/file tmp-dir "foo.txt")))
         "I'm here")))
```

The first parameter `tmp-dir` passed to `with-tmp-dir` is a binding, exposing the
temporary directory path to be used in the body of the macro.

##### :test-with-files.tools/delete-dir

If you supply map with the keyword key `:test-with-files.tools/delete-dir` set
to `false`, the tmp dir will not be cleaned up when it goes out of scope. This
is intended to help with e.g. test debugging.

For example:

```clj
(ns my-test
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]
            [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]
            [test-with-files.tools :as twf :refer [with-tmp-dir]]))
            
(deftest with-tmp-dir-test
    (is (= (with-tmp-dir tmp-dir {::twf/delete-dir false}
             (spit (io/file tmp-dir "foo.txt") "I'm here")
             (println "tmp-dir:" tmp-dir)
             (slurp (io/file tmp-dir "foo.txt")))
           "I'm here"))
```

Will print out the tmp-dir path and leave it in place after the test finishes.
Probably you'll want to remove the `{::twf/delete-dir false}` once you get the
test passing.

#### with-files

Using `with-files`, you get a nice declarative way of creating files to
use in your tests.

```clj
(ns my-test
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]
            [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]
            [test-with-files.tools :refer [with-files]]))

(deftest with-files-test
  (is (= (with-files tmp-dir ["foo.txt" "I'm here"
                              "bar/baz.txt" "Me too"]
           [(slurp (io/file tmp-dir "foo.txt"))
            (slurp (io/file tmp-dir "bar/baz.txt"))])
         ["I'm here" "Me too"])))
```

Like `with-tmp-dir`, the first parameter passed to `with-files` is a binding,
exposing the temporary directory path to be used in the body of the macro.

The second parameter is a vector of relative file path and file content pairs,
inspired by the clojure.core `with-redefs` signature.

All files are deleted afterwards.

#### with-resources

If your code is looking for resources on the class path, instead of files on the
file system, you can use `with-resources` instead.

```clj
(ns my-test
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]
            [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]
            [test-with-files.tools :refer [with-resources]]))

(deftest with-resources-test
  (is (= (with-resources tmp-dir ["foo.txt" "I'm here"
                                  "bar/baz.txt" "Me too"]
           [(slurp (io/resource (str tmp-dir "foo.txt")))
            (slurp (io/resource (str tmp-dir "bar/baz.txt")))])
         ["I'm here" "Me too"])))
```

The signature is the same. `tmp-dir` will now be bound to the relative path.

In order to use this, make sure that `test/resources` is on your resource path.
Using leiningen, that would be done like this:

```clj
:profiles {:dev {:resource-paths ["test/resources"]}}
```

You should probably also add a `.gitkeep` file to `test/resources` if
you have no other files in there - or it is not properly added to the
classpath when leiningen starts.
